# Azure AI Studio Managed Network

One-click deploy:

[![Deploy to Azure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/1-CONTRIBUTION-GUIDE/images/deploytoazure.svg?sanitize=true)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fctava-msft%2Faifoundry-managed-network%2Fmain%2Fazuredeploy.json)

The would need to run the following command to provision the network in cloud powershell:

az ml workspace provision-network -g <resource group> -w <workspace name>

Altenatively, run `azd auth login` and `azd up`.


This template sets up Azure AI Studio with a managed network and connected resources for secure, private deployment with comprehensive networking isolation.

Azure AI Studio is built on Azure Machine Learning as the primary resource provider and takes a dependency on the Cognitive Services (Azure AI Services) resource provider to surface model-as-a-service endpoints for Azure Speech, Azure Content Safety, and Azure OpenAI service.

An 'Azure AI Hub' is a special kind of 'Azure Machine Learning workspace', that is kind = "hub".

## Design

This deployment creates a fully private Azure AI Studio environment with:
- **Inbound Access**: Disabled public access, enabled from selected IP addresses only
- **Outbound Access**: Private with Allow Internet Outbound enabled
- **Identity**: System-managed identity with credential-based authentication
- **Networking**: Complete private endpoint isolation with managed virtual network

## Resources

The following table describes the resources created in the deployment:

| Provider and type | Description |
| - | - |
| `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts` | Azure Storage Account for workspace data and artifacts |
| `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers` | Blob container within the storage account |
| `Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults` | Azure Key Vault for storing secrets and keys |
| `Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces` | Azure AI Hub (ML workspace with kind=hub) |
| `Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/connections` | Connection to Azure OpenAI service from the AI Hub |
| `Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/outboundRules` | Managed outbound rules for AI Search and AI Services |
| `Microsoft.Search/searchServices` | Azure AI Search service with private endpoint connectivity |
| `Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts` | Azure AI Services (kind=AIServices) for OpenAI and other AI models |
| `Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks` | Virtual network for managed network isolation |
| `Microsoft.Network/privateEndpoints` | Private endpoints for all services (AI Hub, Storage, Key Vault, AI Search, AI Services) |
| `Microsoft.Network/privateDnsZones` | Private DNS zones for all private endpoint resolution |
| `Microsoft.Network/privateDnsZones/virtualNetworkLinks` | Links between private DNS zones and virtual network |
| `Microsoft.Network/privateEndpoints/privateDnsZoneGroups` | DNS zone group configuration for private endpoints |
| `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments` | Comprehensive RBAC role assignments for secure access between services |

## Private Endpoints and DNS Zones

### Customer Private Endpoints
The following private endpoints are created for external access:

| Service | Private DNS Zone | Purpose |
| - | - | - |
| AI Foundry Hub | `privatelink.api.azureml.ms` | AI Studio management access |
| AI Foundry Hub | `privatelink.notebooks.azure.net` | Notebook and compute access |
| AI Services | `privatelink.cognitiveservices.azure.com` | AI Services access |
| AI Services | `privatelink.openai.azure.com` | Azure OpenAI access |
| AI Services | `privatelink.services.ai.azure.com` | AI Services API access |
| Storage Account (Blob) | `privatelink.blob.core.windows.net` | Blob storage access |
| Storage Account (File) | `privatelink.file.core.windows.net` | File share access |
| AI Search | `privatelink.search.windows.net` | Search service access |
| Key Vault | `privatelink.vaultcore.azure.net` | Key Vault access |

### Managed Private Endpoints
The AI Hub creates managed private endpoints for:
- Azure AI Search (through connected resources)
- AI Cognitive Service Account (through connected resources)
- Storage Account (through connected resources)

## Security Configuration

### Network Security
- **Public Access**: Disabled for all services
- **Trusted Services**: Enabled where available to allow Microsoft services
- **IP Restrictions**: Customer IP addresses added to allowlists
- **Private Endpoints**: All inter-service communication via private endpoints

### Identity and Access Management
- **Managed Identity**: System-assigned managed identity enabled for all services
- **Authentication**: Entra ID authentication for all connected resources (API keys disabled)
- **Credential Management**: Account key authentication for blob storage connections
